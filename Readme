## We made the following changes in the original code 
1.  We implemented UDP Query in `send_dns_query`
   The original  code had a TODO to send the query via UDP. I implemented it using:
    
     response = dns.query.udp(query, server, timeout=TIMEOUT)
   
   - This will ensure that  the query is actually sent and processed by the DNS server.

2. We resolved Nameservers in `extract_next_nameservers`
   - The original code had a TODO to resolve NS hostnames to IPs. We  completed this by using `dns.resolver.resolve()`:
    
     answers = dns.resolver.resolve(ns_name)
    
   - This step allows the resolver to progress beyond root servers.

3. We updated Iterative Resolution Stages
   - We added logic to transition from ROOT → TLD → AUTH stages in `iterative_dns_lookup`:
    
     if stage == "ROOT":
         stage = "TLD"
     elif stage == "TLD":
         stage = "AUTH"
    
   - This helps to track the progression of resolution.

4.We tried to handle more exceptions in `recursive_dns_lookup`
   - Added handling for specific errors like `NXDOMAIN` and `NoNameservers`:

     except dns.resolver.NXDOMAIN:
         print(f"[ERROR] The domain {domain} does not exist.")
   
   - This will Improve robustness of the recursive resolver.

5. We removed Unnecessary Early `return` in Iterative Lookup.
   - Instead of stopping after a failed query, we used `continue` to try other root servers.
   - This will increase the chances of resolving a domain successfully.



## steps to run the code

##Running the code  in VS Code
1.Ensure you have python3 .Check with the line
sh
python3 --version

2.install dns python libraru using the 
sh
pip3 install dnspython

3. Run the following command based on the mode you want:

  For Iterative DNS Resolution:
  sh
   python3 dns_server.py iterative example.com
   
   For Recursive DNS Resolution:
   sh
   python3 dns_server.py recursive example.com
  
## Usage
## Arguments
- `iterative` → Performs iterative DNS resolution.
- `recursive` → Performs recursive DNS resolution.
- `<domain>` → The domain name to resolve.
